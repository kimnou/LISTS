### write a code that counts the numbers between 20 and 40
### and then print its count

# numbers=[50,40,23,70,56,12,5,10,7]
# for i in numbers:
#     if i>=20 and i<=40:
#         print(i)

# numbers=[50,40,23,70,56,12,5,10,7]
# i=0
# count=0
# while i<len(numbers):
#     if numbers[i]>=20 and numbers[i]<=40:
#         count=count+1
#     i+=1
# print(count)
